### Creating an AI Agent with Mastra, Azure OpenAI, and Terraform
#### Why it's important?

This project provides a clear example of how to efficiently build and deploy a scalable AI agent testing process. It demonstrates a streamlined process for integrating a Large Language Model (LLM) from Azure AI Foundry using Mastra AI and automating the infrastructure setup with Terraform. This approach simplifies model iteration and maintains a well-organized, maintainable codebase.

* **Context:** A step-by-step guide to creating and deploying an AI agent. The process involves defining and deploying a model in Azure AI Foundry using Terraform for infrastructure as code, and then implementing a Mastra AI application that consumes the deployed model. The solution also includes setting up basic guardrails and logging for a more robust and observable system.

* **Technology stack:**  
  - **AI Framework:** Mastra AI, Vercel's AI SDK toolkit  
  - **Cloud Provider:** Azure  
  - **Services:** Azure AI Foundry, Azure Cognitive Services  
  - **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform  
  - **Language:** TypeScript  
  - **Tools:** Azure CLI, pnpm, curl

* **Learnings & Insights:**  
  - Using Terraform to define and deploy Azure resources ensures a consistent and repeatable infrastructure setup, simplifying resource management.  
  - Mastra AI acts as a powerful abstraction layer, allowing for the easy swapping of different LLM models and providers without extensive code changes.  
  - Implementing AI guardrails directly in the infrastructure setup (via Azure Cognitive Services policies) is a proactive way to ensure model safety and compliance.  
  - Creating a reusable model definition function and a dedicated logger promotes a clear separation of concerns, making the application easier to test and maintain.  
  - The combination of these tools results in a highly organized and scalable project structure for building AI agents.

* **Status:** Completed.
