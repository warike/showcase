### Automating a Mastra AI Workflow in AWS Lambda Using EventBridge

#### Why it is important?

This project provides a comprehensive blueprint for deploying a serverless, event-driven generative AI workflow on AWS. It demonstrates how to orchestrate an AI agent using the Mastra framework, package it for serverless execution, provision the necessary cloud infrastructure with Terraform, and fully automate the deployment process with GitHub Actions. This approach creates a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for integrating AI agents into business processes.

  * **Context:** This is a step-by-step guide to building and deploying an automated reporting workflow. The workflow uses a Mastra AI agent powered by a Google Gemini model to generate reports. This agent is part of a multi-step process (fetch data, generate report, send report) that is packaged in a Docker container, deployed as an AWS Lambda function, and triggered on a schedule by an Amazon EventBridge rule.

  * **Technology stack:**

      * **AI Framework:** Mastra.ai
      * **Cloud Provider:** AWS
      * **Services:** AWS Lambda, Amazon EventBridge, Amazon ECR, AWS IAM, AWS SSM Parameter Store, Amazon CloudWatch
      * **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform
      * **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
      * **Containerization:** Docker
      * **Language:** TypeScript

  * **Learnings & Insights:**

      * Mastra.ai simplifies the creation and management of agentic workflows, providing clear primitives for chaining tasks like `.then()` and parallelizing them with `.foreach()`.
      * Combining Terraform for infrastructure, Docker for application packaging, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD results in a highly robust and fully automated solution within the AWS ecosystem.
      * For scheduled, infrequent tasks, the combination of AWS Lambda and EventBridge is an extremely cost-effective serverless solution, often falling entirely within the AWS free tier.
      * Explicitly managing cloud resources like IAM roles and CloudWatch log groups with Terraform is a best practice that prevents orphaned resources and ensures a clean, maintainable infrastructure.
      * While packaging the entire workflow into a single Lambda is straightforward, a more scalable approach for intensive parallel tasks would involve breaking the workflow into separate functions to better leverage Lambda's scaling capabilities.

  * **Status:** Completed.
